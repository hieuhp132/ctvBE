        '\r\n' +
        '2. Experience or is willing to learn Hotwire / Stimulus? Detail? \r\n' +
        " While I haven't worked directly with Hotwire or Stimulus yet, I have relevant experience with Turbo (a Hotwire component) in Rails prototypes and am very willing—and excited—to learn them quickly. My background in server-side rendering (SSR) with Next.js and real-time updates via WebSockets positions me well to adopt these for enhancing Rails apps with minimal JavaScript, aligning with my growth mindset.\r\n" +

        'Minimum Requirements\r\n' +
        '1. Do you have 4+ years of experience building and owning backend/platform systems end-to-end? Yes, I have over four years of experience as a full-stack engineer, and the core of my roles has been building and owning backend and platform systems end-to-end. At both JazzB AI and CereBulb, I was responsible for architecting and deploying Python-based microservices using Django and FastAPI. This included designing scalable data models in PostgreSQL, implementing secure REST APIs, and orchestrating asynchronous workflows using RabbitMQ and Redis for high performance.\r\n' +
        '2. Have you worked at an early-stage, high-growth startup or founded/built your own project? Yes, I have extensive experience in early-stage, high-growth startups, specifically at JazzB AI and CereBulb, Scaleteam. This experience means I thrive in environments that require high agency and a bias toward action. I took direct ownership of full-stack product development, often building features from a "zero-to-one" concept to a fully deployed production system, and constantly balanced speed with stability.\r\n' +
        '3. Have you not applied to Revic before? Yes, I have not applied to Revic before, and I am highly focused on this opportunity.\r\n' +
        '4. Are you able to work hybrid (3 days/week) in San Francisco, New York City, or Vancouver (or relocate within an agreed timeline)? Yes\r\n' +
        '5. Do you have production experience with React + Python? Yes, I have extensive production experience with the React + Python stack. I used Python with Django and FastAPI to build secure, high-throughput backend APIs and used React.js with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS to craft the highly responsive, user-facing applications. This combination is my strongest area of expertise for building scalable platforms\r\n' +

        '\r\n' +
        '3. What is the most recent technology or skill you taught yourself, and how did you apply it? The most recent skill I taught myself was LLM orchestration. I applied this to build a RAG pipeline that provided a multi-agent system with access to a domain-specific knowledge base. This was essential for our AI agent to produce accurate and relevant content without hallucinating.\r\n' +
        '\r\n' +
        '4. Describe a feature or system you built. What problem did it solve for users or the business, and what metrics improved? At JazzB AI, I built a full-stack platform centered around an AI agent designed to automate SEO content generation. The problem was that creating high-quality, keyword-optimized content was a manual and time-consuming process. The system I built connected an LLM (specifically OpenAI and Gemini) with a database of SEO insights via a custom RAG pipeline, allowing the agent to generate tailored, data-driven content. This solution reduced our manual marketing sync efforts by over 60% and increased user workflow efficiency by 3x.\r\n' +
        '\r\n' +
        "5. What do you understand about Revic’s product and market? What questions do you have about our approach?

I'd like to learn more about the specific challenges you're currently facing and how you see the role evolving as the company scales.\r\n" +
        '\r\n' +
        '6. Why do you want to work at an early-stage startup? What do you believe it takes to succeed in such an environment? I am passionate about working at early-stage startups because I thrive in environments that require high ownership and a hands-on approach. To succeed, I believe it takes a combination of technical expertise, adaptability, and a relentless bias for action. The ability to tackle ambiguity, learn quickly, and collaborate closely with a small, mission-driven team is essential.\r\n' +

        '1. What’s the most recent technology or skill you taught yourself, and how did you apply it?\r\n' +

        ' \r\n' +
        '2. Describe a feature/system you built. What problem did it solve, and what metrics improved? \r\n' +
        '--- At Just Right Reader, I built a data aggregation tool with Node.js and React that let analysts upload spreadsheets and automatically receive cleaned, structured data for sales fulfillment. Previously, this was done manually and was error-prone. The tool cut processing time from hours to minutes, reduced mistakes by over 80%, and gave the sales team faster access to accurate data, directly improving turnaround for customer orders. \r\n' +

        "--- From what I gather, Revic is using AI to pull together a lot of scattered sales data and then help revenue teams act on it automatically. It sounds like the idea is to cut down the busywork in CRMs and dashboards so reps can spend more time actually selling. I’m not fully sure yet how that looks day to day for a rep, but it seems like a big opportunity since almost every company struggles with sales execution. I'm curious about a few things:\r\n" +
        ' What does a rep actually experience when using Revic. Does it feel like an assistant, or more like automated updates in the background?\r\n' +

        '4. Why do you want to work at an early-stage startup? What does it take to succeed there? \r\n' +
        '--- I want to work at an early-stage startup because I enjoy having ownership, moving quickly, and seeing my work directly impact customers. To succeed, I think it takes adaptability, a bias for action, and the ability to work with ambiguity, shipping fast, learning, and iterating while keeping the bigger picture in mind. \r\n' +

        "Yes, I'm using Rust every day in Blockchain projects. I'm Rust Smart Contract Developer using Anchor mainly.\r\n" +
        'I worked on situations where many accounts could be changed in the same transaction. To keep it safe, I use Rust’s ownership system, which makes sure memory and access are handled correctly. Also, Anchor with its macros and constraints helps a lot, because it makes account validation easier and avoids common mistakes with concurrency and memory.\r\n' +
        'Maybe there are two projects on Solana where I implemented an important piece of logic. The first one, I had to develop a staking program, where I had to calculate manually each reward taking extreme care regarding overflows, underflows, etc. I used SPL, to receive/hold, transfer and mint tokens.\r\n' +
        'And maybe the second one was a program where I had to receive SOL and swap as many random tokens as I could (randombag.fun). And the problem here was that I had to do that in only one tx, so I had to manage each random account by remaining accounts manually and implement ALTs (https://solana.com/es/developers/guides/advanced/lookup-tables), increment the CU limit and use a custom allocator heap because the tx was very heavy in each way.\r\n' +
        '\r\n' +
        'Yes, I have more than 2 years of experience as Solana Smart Contract Engineer using Anchor framework. The biggest challenge maybe was to successfully develop randombag.fun because each limit was reached when I wanted to swap as many tokens as I could. But reading the documentation, asking/reading the Solana forums and with a lot of debugging and testing was done successfully.\r\n' +
        'Yes, I have experience with SPL. Almost all projects use tokens, so I use SPL in almost all projects. And SPL extensions too, the most common is Metadata extension by Metaplex and also used Transfer Hook extension and cNFT (compressed NFTs). These last two were by testing projects.\r\n' +
        '\r\n' +
        `I didn't contribute to any big open-source blockchain project. I just contributed in a Colosseum Hackathon project in the past edition of the Boltick project (boltick.com.ar). I had to "audit" with a lot of testing the Anchor program and solve some problems in the code. Mainly I did testing using Typescript and Rust. And when I found some bugs and security problems I fix these problems on the Anchor program.\r\n` +
